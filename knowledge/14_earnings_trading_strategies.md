## PEAD Fundamentals and Academic Foundation / PEAD基礎と学術的基盤

### Understanding PEAD Phenomenon / PEAD現象の理解

**Definition and Characteristics**:
- Stock prices continue moving in direction of earnings surprise for 60-90 days
- Magnitude: 2-8% additional return over drift period
- Market inefficiency due to delayed information processing
- Well-documented anomaly since 1960s academic research

**Behavioral Finance Foundations**:
- **Under-reaction Hypothesis**: Investors initially under-react to earnings news
- **Limited Attention Theory**: Finite processing capacity of market participants
- **Anchoring Bias**: Slow adjustment from previous expectations
- **Institutional Herding**: Professional investors following momentum patterns

### Modern Market Considerations / 現代市場の考慮事項

**Current Environment Changes**:
- Reduced magnitude due to algorithmic trading and increased efficiency
- Shorter duration in liquid large-cap stocks
- Still profitable but requires sophisticated execution
- Technology and data advantages crucial for success

**Factors Affecting PEAD Strength**:
- Size of earnings surprise (>5% vs consensus for significant impact)
- Company size (stronger effect in small/mid-cap stocks)
- Analyst coverage (fewer analysts = stronger drift)
- Market volatility and regime conditions

## Multi-Timeframe PEAD Strategies / マルチタイムフレームPEAD戦略

### Short-Term Strategy (Days to Weeks) / 短期戦略

#### Immediate Post-Earnings Reaction
**Strategy Characteristics**:
- Target immediate market overreactions within 1-5 days
- Capitalize on volatility expansion and momentum
- High turnover requiring active management

**Implementation Criteria**:
- Earnings surprise >5% vs consensus estimates
- Revenue growth >10% year-over-year
- Volume >2x average on announcement day
- Technical momentum confirmation

**Options Strategies for Volatility**:
- Long straddles/strangles before earnings (volatility expansion)
- Iron condors post-earnings (volatility crush)
- Calendar spreads for time decay exploitation

### Medium-Term Strategy (Weeks to Months) / 中期戦略

#### Drift Phenomenon Tracking
**Core Strategy Elements**:
- Hold positions during 60-90 day momentum phase
- Combine technical analysis with fundamental improvements
- Systematic approach to drift duration and magnitude

**Entry and Management**:
- Entry: Earnings surprise >3% with revenue beat
- Position size: 3-5% of portfolio initially
- Stop loss: 21-day moving average breakdown
- Profit target: 15-25% gains over holding period

#### Fundamental Analysis Integration
**Earnings Quality Assessment**:
- Distinguish temporary vs sustainable surprises
- Revenue growth quality and margin expansion
- Cash flow generation consistency
- Management guidance reliability

### Long-Term Strategy (Months to Years) / 長期戦略

#### Value Investment Integration
**PEAD as Entry Trigger**:
- Use earnings surprises to identify undervalued opportunities
- Combine drift momentum with DCF model updates
- Core holding additions for high-quality companies
- Portfolio construction with earnings-driven selections

## Enhanced Risk Management Framework / 強化リスク管理フレームワーク

### Volatility-Based Position Sizing / ボラティリティベースポジションサイジング

#### ATR-Based Methodology
**Implementation Process**:
- Calculate 14-day Average True Range (ATR)
- Position size = Risk amount ÷ (ATR × Price)
- Automatic risk adjustment for market conditions
- Consistent risk exposure across all positions

#### Target Volatility Strategy
**Dynamic Leverage Adjustment**:
- Set annual target volatility (e.g., 10%)
- Adjust leverage based on realized volatility
- Increase positions during calm periods, reduce during stress

### Market Trend Filtering / 市場トレンドフィルタリング

#### Broad Market Condition Assessment
**Trend Filter Implementation**:
- S&P 500 above/below 200-day moving average
- New long positions only in bull market conditions
- Defensive positioning during bear markets
- Historical effectiveness shows significant drawdown reduction

#### Macro Indicator Integration
**Risk-Off Triggers**:
- VIX levels: >30 reduced positions, >40 risk-off mode
- Credit spread monitoring (high-yield vs Treasury)
- Economic indicators: ISM Manufacturing, unemployment trends
- Automated risk adjustment based on threshold breaches

### Drawdown Control Mechanisms / ドローダウン制御

#### Fixed Percentage Method
**Implementation Rules**:
- 5% drawdown: Reduce position sizes by 25%
- 10% drawdown: Reduce position sizes by 50%
- 15% drawdown: Stop new positions entirely
- 20% drawdown: Close all positions and review strategy

#### Correlation Risk Management
**Position Correlation Monitoring**:
- Limit exposure to 0.8+ correlated positions (max 30% of portfolio)
