The most expensive form of self-sabotage:

Emotional decision-making.

It's why you can't stay profitable, execute consistently, or handle drawdowns.

The 6 hard truths from Jim Simons that shattered my obsession with "traditional trading":


1. Math beats emotions.

"We don't override the models."

While most traders let fear and greed dictate decisions,
Simons built systems that execute automatically.

All with one focus: exploiting their alphas in the market.

Rule is we never override the computer. No one ever comes in any day and says "the computer wants to do this"—that's crazy. We shouldn't do it.

You don't do it because you can't. You can't simulate that. You can't study the past and wonder whether the boss was going to come in and change his mind about something.

So you just stick with it, and it's worked 



2.  Alpha over intuition.

After experiencing the gut-wrenching experience of discretionary trading,

Simons focused solely on models and alpha.

He let the data dictate his decisions, removing the guessing.


At the end of about a 10-year run, it was clear to me that this gut-wrenching business of fundamental... I mean, if you're doing fundamental trading, one morning you come in, you feel like a genius. Your positions are all your way, and you think, God, I'm really smart. And look at all the money I made overnight. 

Then the next day you come in, and they've gone against you, and you feel like an idiot. We were pretty good at it, but it just didn't seem to be a way... To live your life. So building models, go with the models. 

By 1988, I decided it's going to be 100% models. And it has been ever since. 


3. The power of huge sample sizes.

Renaissance analyzed terabytes of market data when others used simple charts.

They knew what statisticians understand: larger samples reveal true patterns hidden in noise.

A backtest on 20 trades means nothing. Test across 1000s.


I mean, you look at everything, right? You look at weather, length of dresses, personal opinion. Length of dresses we didn't try. What sort of things? Well, everything. I mean, everything is brisk for the mill, except hem lengths, I have to say.

Weather, annual reports, monthly, quarterly reports, the historic data itself, volumes—you name it, whatever there is. We take in terabytes of data a day and store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis. And you're looking for anomalies. You're looking for, like you said, the efficient market hypothesis.

But any one anomaly might be just a random thing. So is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies and see when they align? Well, any one anomaly might be a random thing. However, if you have enough data, you can tell that it's not.

So you can see an anomaly that's persisted for a sufficiently long time, so the probability of it being random is not high. But these things fade after a while. Anomalies can get washed out, so you have to keep on top.  


4.  One strategy is not going to last.

Every alpha will fade over time.

For this reason, research has been a consistent focus.

The best traders aren't finding one "perfect" strategy—they're constantly researching and combining multiple strategies.


To hire the best possible people and the research goes on all the time. All the time we're doing research trying to find new predictive signals.

For example, that's a big example. So a signal is—well, you know what a signal is. A predictive signal is a signal that tells you what's going to happen. Some probability of, right? With a greater than, probability greater than a half.

And the more of these signals that you have, and independent, they're not correlated with each other. They're highly correlated; it's really just one signal. But the more you have, the better. And we have—I won't even say the number, and I'm not sure what it is—but it's a very large number ahead of everybody to hire the best possible people. 


Investing firms say, "Oh, they have models." What they typically mean is: we have a model and it advises the trader what to do, and if he likes the advice he'll take it and if he doesn't like the advice he won't take it. Well, that's...you can't...that's not science. You can't simulate how you would do.

How were you feeling when you got out of bed 13 years ago when you're looking at historical simulations? 


5. Manual backtesting is a ticking time bomb.

Manual backtesting is full of human biases that skew results.

Renaissance built rigorous computer testing that analyzed decades of price data with zero emotion.

Clear criteria, objective conditions, and thousands of historical samples are what you need.



And bringing in data, in those days we sent gals down to the New York Federal Reserve to copy histories of interest rate numbers. They didn't exist in the 70s. You couldn't go and buy data, and there was certainly not online deliveries of all this stuff.

So to build the original models, we needed to collect a lot of data.
