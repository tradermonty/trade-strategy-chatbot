**Optimization Dangers**:
- Excessive parameters increase curve-fitting risk
- Fine-tuning reduces strategy robustness
- Complex adjustments may capture noise rather than signal
- Over-optimization often fails in new market conditions

**Crude Trend Following Approach**:
- Simple trend identification methods
- Basic breakout recognition systems
- Minimal parameter adjustments
- Focus on major market movements rather than minor fluctuations

#### Historical Validation
**Recent Market Examples**:
- Strong trending markets validate trend-following approaches
- Simple strategies often outperform complex ones during major moves
- Consistent rule application crucial during market acceleration
- Discipline in execution more important than strategy sophistication

### Trader's Primary Responsibilities / トレーダーの主要責任
